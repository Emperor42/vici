</HEADER>
<H2>PROJECT TEMPLATE</H2>
<P>
A PROJECT TEMPLATE CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING HIERARCHY AND INCLUDES ITEMS, LABELS AND CARDS
-> ITEMS
--> ITEMS ARE WORK ITEM WHICH RELATE IN SOME WAY TO TO THE PROJECT AT HAND THESE CAN BE BOTH TRACKED AND UNTRACKED
--> ITEMS EXHIBIT THE FOLLOWIGN HIERARCHY AND CAN EITHER BE OPENED OR CLOSED FOR TRACKING/ARCHIVING PURPOSES
---> MILESTONE: AN ITEM MADE OF MANY OF THE LOWER ITEMS LISTED HERE, ESSENTIALLY A PROJECT IN ITS OWN RIGHT (OPEN OR CLOSED)
---> PULL REQUEST (PR) A FIXED CODE CHANGE OR STAGE OF THE PROJECT (OPEN OR CLOSED)
---> ISSUES: PRIMARY WORK ITEMS WHICH ARE TRACKED AND HAVE NOTES TAKEN, USUALLY WILL TAKE MULTIPLE EVENTS TO ADEQUATLY TRACK (OPEN OR CLOSED)
---> DRAFT: SECONDARY WORK ITEMS WHCIH ARE TRACKED AND SHOULD NOT TAKE MORE THAN AN HOUR (ALWAYS OPEN)
-> LABELS
--> LABELS ALLOW FOR THE TRACKING AND IDENTIFYING OF SIMILAR TOPICS WITHIN A SPECIFIC PROJECT MORE OR LESS THEY ARE FLAGS OR STANDARD NOTES FOR A GIVEN PROJECT
-> CARDS
--> CARDS ARE USED TO PLAN FOR FUTURE PROGRESS
---> CARDS TRACK THE FOLLOWING ITEMS 
----> STATUS: WHAT TYPE OF WORK IS HAPPENING ON THIS ITEM
-----> NOTE: JUST A GENERAL NOTE, NOT AN ACTUAL WORK ITEM BUT IS USED TO LOG NON-WORK AND ADMIN TIME
-----> OPEN: WORK IS ACTIVLY BEING DONE ON THIS ITEM
-----> FLAG: THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE WORK BEING DONE ON THIS ITEM
-----> HOLD: DO NOT CONINUTE WORK ON THIS ITEM, BUT THE ITEM IS STILL OPEN, DO NOT LOG
-----> STOP: DO NOT CONTINUE WORK ON THIS ITEM, LOG AS CLOSED OR CANCELLED
-----> DONE: WORK HAS BEEN COMPLETED ON THIS ITEM
----> STAGE: WHERE IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS IS THIS ITEM
-----> TRIAGE: INITIAL HIGH-LEVEL ESTIMATION OF THE ITEM
-----> BACKLOG: INITIAL MEDIUM LEVEL AND SCHEDULING OF THE ITEM'S DESIGN AND SIMILAR PHASES
-----> PLANNING: ACTUAL DESIGN PHASE OF THE ITEM
-----> DESIGNED: UPDATE PLANNING AND PROJECT DATES, HOLD HERE UNTIL WORK CAN BEGIN
-----> ONGOING: ITEM IS IN BUILD PHASE
-----> TESTING: ITEM IS BEING TESTED
-----> APPROVAL: TESTING IS COMPLETE, WAITING ON APPROVAL TO DEPLOY
-----> COMPLETE: ITEM HAS BEEN CLEARED AND IS READY TO BE DEPLOYED, CLOSE WHEN THE ITEM HAS BEEN DEPLOYED
----> DUE DATE: WHEN TO START WORK
----> LOG DATE: WHEN WORK WAS COMPLETED
----> TRIAGE DATE: WHEN TO COMPLETE TRIAGE
----> BACKLOG DATE: WHEN TO START PLANNING
----> PLANNING DATE: WHEN TO FINISH PLANNING
----> DESIGNED DATE: WHEN TO START BUILD PHASE
----> ONGOING DATE: WHEN BUILD PHASE ENDS
----> TESTING DATE: WHEN TESTING PHASE ENDS
----> APPROVAL DATE: WHEN DEPLOYMENT IS APPROVED
----> COMPLETE DATE: WHEN DEPLOYMENT IS COMPLETE (PLANNED)
----> OPEN DATE: WHEN THE ITEM WAS CREATED
----> PRIORITY: BLOCKS OF A GIVEN DAY WHERE THIS ITEM WILL BE WORKED ON
----> EFFORT: CURRENT STANGE OF WORK WHICH HAS BEEN COMPLETED PLUS BUFFER TIME
----> ESTIMATE: CLAIMED ESTIMATE, ESSNEITALLY THE BUDGET FOR A GIVEN ITEM
</P>
<H2>XML BASED DESIGN</H2>
<P>
-> ALLOWS FOR DESIGNS TO BE COMPLETED IN A PSUDO-CODE TYPE FORMAT
-> ALLOWS FOR INSIGHTS INTO COPMPLETNESS OF DESIGN TO BE GENERATED OUT BY A SYSTEM
-> NO FORMAL SCHEMA, VICI XML IS AN OPEN STANDARD WITH THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS
-> CAN BE USED FOR GENERAL PLANNING AND SCHEMES

INVALID

<ITEM>...</ITEM>
ITEM: THE MOST BASIS XML NODE, ESSENTIALLY THERE SHOULD BE NO ITEMS IN A VALID DESIGN/PLAN 

<STUB><I></I>...<O></O></STUB>
STUB: USED FOR SYSTEM DESIGN, THIS PATTERN IS USED TO EXPLICITLY DEFINE AN ITEM WHICH HAS NOT BEEN FULLY DESIGNED YET 

VALID TAGS (</NODE> IS A PLACEHOLDER FOR ANY VALID NODE

<LINK/>
LINK: AN XML NODE WITH NO CHILDREN, THIS COULD BE A UNIQUE PROCESS OR ELEMENT, IT IS AN XML NODE WITH ZERO CHILDREN OR A TEXT-ONLY NODE

<DATA>
  </NODE>
</DATA>
DATA: AN XML NODE WITH EXACTLY ONE CHILD, ESSENTIALLY AN ALIAS, LINKS CAN BE USED TO AUTOMATICALLY CONNECT TO THIS WHEN RUNNIGN WITH VIDI

<PATH>
  </NODE>
  </NODE>
<PATH>
PATH: AN XML NODE WITH EXACTLY 2 CHILDREN, ALLOWS FOR MORE COMPLEX TREE STRUCTURES IN PLANS AND OR DATA

<GATE>
  </NODE>
  </NODE>
  </NODE>
  </NODE>
</GATE>
GATE: AN XML NODE WITH EXACTLY 4 CHILDREN THE FIRST TWO NODES ARE COMPARED IF THEY ARE THE SAME THEN EXECUTE THE THIRD NODE (CONTINUE PROCESSING AT THAT NODE) IF THEY ARE NOT THE SAME USE THE FOURTH

<CODE>
  </*>
  </NODE>
  </NODE>
</CODE>
CODE: ALLOWS FOR COMPARISONS AND SOME LOGICAL EXPRESSIONS, RESOLVED AS EITHER <PASS/> OR <FAIL/> AND WHERE </*> IS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS LISTED BELOW, NOTE ANY OTHER TAGS HERE FILL ALWAYS FAIL HAS EXACTLY 3 ELEMENTS
-> </MORE> TREAT THE FIRST TEXT NODE AS BEING STRICTLY GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO THE SECOND TEXT NODE
-> </LESS> TREAT THE FIRST TEXT NODE AS BEING STRICTLY LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO THE SECOND TEXT NODE
-> </SAME> TREAT THE FIRST TEXT NODE AS BEING STRICTLY EQUAL TO THE SECOND TEXT NODE
-> </ABOVE> TREAT THE FIRST TEXT NODE AS BEING STRICTLY GREATER THAN THE SECOND TEXT NODE
-> </BELOW> TREAT THE FIRST TEXT NODE AS BEING STRICTLY LESS THAN THE SECOND TEXT NODE
-> </NAND> TREAT THIS AS A NAND GATE COMPARISON TRUTH BEING IF THE TWO NODES ARE THE SAME

<!----> IS A COMMENT AS IN STANDARD XML

AUTOMATIC RESOLUTION CAN BE DEVELOPED WITH THIS SYSTEM AS CAN VISUAL GENERATION OF DESIGNS, REGARDLESS THIS FRAMEWORK FORCES ONCE TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASPECTS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AND CAN FOLLOW A MORE ACCURATE LINE TOTAL ESTIMATION OF COMPLETION

PLANNING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENMT VIA XML BASED DESIGN
-> ULTIMATLY FOR A GIVEN SET TIME ONE CAN USE AN XML DESIGNPLAN TO DETERMINE AN ACCURATE ESTIMATE AS MORE COMPELX ELEMENTS END UP WITH BUILT IN DOCUMENTATION VIA COMMENTING AND OR THE REMAINIGN TAGS THEMSELVES
-->EACH LINE OF THE XML DESIGNPLAN CAN CORRESPOND TO A GIVEN UNIT OF BLOCK IN THE DAY, THIS BLOCK CAN BE SET BY DEFAULT AS ONE HOUR OR MODIFIED THEREIN
-->PLEASE COUNT COMMENTS IN THE GIVEN ESTIMATE
